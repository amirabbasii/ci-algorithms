## Descreption:
In this project we have trained a Cats vs Dog Classifier with the help of transfer learning using vgg19 and imagenet. Libraries being used in this project are Numpy, Tensorflow and Keras, some of the most powerful deep learning frameworks right now. The dataset that we used to train and test the model on was all done on Microsoft's Cats and Dogs dataset (https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/E/1/3E1C3F21-ECDB-4869-8368-6DEBA77B919F/kagglecatsanddogs_3367a.zip) with Adam optimizer.
